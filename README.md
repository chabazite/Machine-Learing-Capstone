# Machine-Learing-Capstone
This was the capstone project for the IBM Data Science Course. Over 5 weeks we were charged with investigating SpaceX's Falcon 9 stage 1 rockets. 

The objective was to create predictive models for the outcome of the stage 1 rockets based on a variety of data from the Launch Sites. Finally
we were asked to present our work in the form of a powerpoint report, which you will find here.
